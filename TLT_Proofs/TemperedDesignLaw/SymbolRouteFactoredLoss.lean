# The symbol-level route-factored loss and the symbol-channel soft↔hard bridge (TD0.5)

`RouteFactoredLoss` (in `RouteFactoredLoss.lean`) is the **output-Lipschitz** factorization: it admits the
clipped/Lipschitz regression losses but, as its modelling note records, **not** the 0-1 routing loss
(discontinuous in the output). This file lands the **strictly weaker symbol-level form** that note flagged:
the loss lives on the routed **symbol** `Fin k` rather than the output `V`, so it admits the 0-1 routing
loss, and the soft-vs-hard penalty absorbs the **off-route mass** (the indicator that the soft top-one route
disagrees with the hard route) instead of an output-Lipschitz deviation.

## The genuine soft↔hard bridge for the symbol channel

For the tempered family at any sharpness `β > 0`, `TD0_symbol_invariant_proof` gives that the soft mixture's
top-one route (`leastArgmax (softWeights …)`) is **exactly** the hard route — the symbol channel does not see
the temperature. Hence the off-route penalty is identically `0` and the soft symbol channel's 0-1 route-loss
concept *equals* the hard route-loss concept `routeLossConcept`. Concretely
(`softRouteLossConcept_mem_routeLossClass`) the soft symbol channel's 0-1 loss is a **member of the very class
`routeLossClass` that S5's `symbolRoute_gen_gap` (Sauer) bounds** — so the hard certificate certifies the soft
symbol channel verbatim, with no surrogate. This closes the symbol-channel half of the soft↔hard bridge that
was open since S2.

## What this does NOT close (a genuine claim-strength fork, surfaced not fabricated)

This bridges the **0-1 symbol/route** channel only. Whether the *smooth* (output-Lipschitz / Dudley, S1)
certificate certifies the **same** generalization quantity as the 0-1 hard certificate is a separate, genuine
modelling decision (the factorization-strength choice the `RouteFactoredLoss` note flags "for ratification"):
either (a) commit the design law to a **surrogate** bound `0-1 ≤ Lipschitz surrogate` (a margin/calibration
claim), so the smooth certificate bounds the 0-1 route gap too; or (b) keep the two certificates **per-channel**
(output regression vs symbol routing) and redesign `CapacityProfile` to carry a gap per channel. That fork
changes what the certificate *claims*; it is surfaced to the operator, not decided here.

/-- **A symbol-level route-factored loss.** A loss on the routed **symbol** `Fin k` (uniformly bounded and
nonnegative), the strictly weaker companion of the output-Lipschitz `RouteFactoredLoss`. Because the loss is
read off the discrete symbol rather than the continuous output, it **admits the 0-1 routing loss**
(`zeroOneSymbolLoss`), which the output-Lipschitz form cannot. -/

/-- **The symbol route-factored bound.** The soft top-one route's loss is at most the hard route's loss plus
an **off-route penalty**: `0` when the routes agree, and at most `bound` when they disagree. This is the
symbol-channel analogue of `RouteFactoredLoss.mixture_le_route`; the penalty absorbs the routing disagreement
rather than an output deviation, which is exactly what lets the 0-1 loss factor. -/

/-- **The symbol-channel soft↔hard bridge.** For `β > 0` the soft symbol channel's 0-1 route-loss concept is
**equal** to the hard route-loss concept: by `TD0_symbol_invariant_proof` the soft top-one route is the hard
route, so the two 0-1 losses coincide pointwise. The off-route penalty of `softRoute_le_hardRoute` is therefore
identically `0` on the tempered family — the symbol channel is sharpness-blind. -/

/-- **The soft symbol channel is certified by S5.** For `β > 0` the soft 0-1 route-loss concept is a member of
the hard route-loss class `routeLossClass A.router`, so S5's uniform symbol-route generalization bound
(`symbolRoute_gen_gap`, the Sauer–Shelah arrangement bound) — which controls *every* concept in that class —
certifies the soft symbol channel verbatim, **without any surrogate**. This is the genuine closure of the
symbol-channel soft↔hard bridge open since S2. -/
