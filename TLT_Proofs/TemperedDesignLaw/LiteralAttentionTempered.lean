# The literal binding — the tempered design law on TorchLean's attention

The design law is abstract over `TemperedRouterFamily`, which bundles a `FiniteScoreRouterCode` with a
sharpness `β`. TorchLean's scaled-dot-product attention score is already a `FiniteScoreRouterCode`
(`Bridge.attentionScoreRouter`), so it *is* a tempered router family — and every β-axis result instantiates
onto the literal attention with no extra hypotheses beyond what the abstract theorems require.

* `litAttnTempered` — TorchLean's scaled-dot-product attention as a tempered router family at sharpness `β`.
* `litAttn_leakage_upper` — the two-sided leakage law on the literal attention: the off-route softmax mass
  is `≤ (nK−1)·exp(−β·γ)`.
* `litAttn_symbol_invariant` — for `β > 0` the literal soft attention's `leastArgmax` is the hard attention
  route (the symbol channel does not see the temperature).
* `litAttn_route_stable` — the executed route equals the ideal route off the `u`-shell.

These are the abstract design-law theorems (`TD0`/`TD2`/`TD7`) applied to `litAttnTempered`; the content is in
those theorems and in the `attentionScoreRouter` binding. The hardening envelope on the literal value vectors —
where the soft mixture is identified with the actual `Spec.scaledDotProductAttention` output — is
`litAttn_hardening_literal` in `SoftOutputCorrespondence` (it needs the soft-output correspondence, so it lives
downstream of this file).
